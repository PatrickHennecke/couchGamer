xbox_connected.sh and xbox-wrapper.sh should be in /usr/local/bin these will launch couchGamer if an xbox controller is connected and there is no exe running

couchGamer-listener.sh should be found in .local/bin this needs to be enabled as a service so it listens for when an xbox controller is connected.
